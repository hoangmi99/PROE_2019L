The project was devided into three parts:

  Getting acquainted with the concept of constructors, destructors and operators.
* description of the 2nd part  
  Extendind the previous part by adding inheritance, abstract class etc.   
  Creating a Doxygen documantation of the project
* description of the 3rd part
